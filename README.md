About data structures and algorithms

Problems can be soved in two methodologies
1. Recursion: Recursion is the process of a function calling itself
2. Iteration: Using exclusive loop in the code


Trees:
Trees are one of the frequent problems encountered in the interviews.

 Node: Node is an abstract data type. It has two things. First it stores value which can be of any data type. Second, it stores pointer to another node.
 Graph: Graph is collection of nodes and pointers to other other nodes. Nodes of a graph(Tree) are called vertices and pointers that connect nodes are called edges.
 
 Tree is a type of graph. In a binary tree, all nodes have maximum of two children.
